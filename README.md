# MaRS_Kitty
Walking Quadruped Robot
Kitty is a Quadruped that we are building under Models and Robotics Section, IIT Roorkee.
This four legged walking robot will mimic the gait cycle of a cat with a soul purpose of providing help in natural calamities where
normal robots find it extremely to move.
Thank You.
